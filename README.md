# Python Scripts

This repository just houses a collection of python scripts for testing infrastructure, building projects, generating data and a host of other things as well. Time to time I will also add scripts to generate charts from data and prototype ideas. However as all of these are rather small items I decided to house all scripts in a single repository.
